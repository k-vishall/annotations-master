## 🌟 What You'll Learn
1. **Basics of Annotations**: Understand built-in annotations like `@Override`, `@Deprecated`, and `@SuppressWarnings` and their purpose.
2. **Custom Annotations**: Learn how to create your own annotations and define their behavior.
3. **Meta-Annotations**: Explore `@Retention`, `@Target`, `@Documented`, and `@Inherited` to design flexible and efficient annotations.
4. **Advanced Concepts**:
   - Process annotations at runtime using reflection.
   - Build custom annotation processors with **APT** (Annotation Processing Tool).
5. **Real-World Applications**: See how annotations are used in frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and in custom scenarios like validation and logging.
